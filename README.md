## General info
This is the project for the university course "Algorithms for massive data".
The aim is to implement the classifier to distinguish between real and comic faces from the following [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/defileroff/comic-faces-paired-synthetic-v2). For this purpose, the convolutional neural network based on VGG architecture was implemented. The report can be found [here](https://github.com/kkonstantin182/face-comic-recognizer/blob/main/documents/docs/report.pdf).
